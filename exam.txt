 - look at the midterm
 - recursion, higher-order functions, datatypes, pattern matching,
    exceptions
 - tail recursion
 - interface vs. implementation in modules

Concepts:    
 - static / dynamic typechecking
 - strong / weak typechecking
 - static scoping
   - for every use of a variable, can statically determine
      which declaration it refers to
      - lexically closest in the surrounding scope
 - parametric polymorphism
 - static overloading

Object oriented
 - inheritance
 - subtyping
 - dynamic dispatch
 - memory and pointers in Java
 - exceptions in Java
 - generics in Java
 - parallelism (fork/join and streams)

Python
 - comprehensions

Prolog
 - unification
 - building the proof tree for a query
 - writing simple programs
