(* we'd like to separate *interface* from *implementation*

   above we're using lists as our implementation of dictionaries
   and this is exposed to clients of the module.
   why is this undesirable?
   - maintainability / software evolution
     - the implementer wants flexiblity to change the implementation
       without breaking clients
   - security/privacy - want to be able to hide some data
   - might be necessary for correctness
     - example: consider a set implemented as a list
     - can't ensure the invariant that the list has no duplicates

  solution: use an explicit module type (aka "signature") to hide
   the implementation type
