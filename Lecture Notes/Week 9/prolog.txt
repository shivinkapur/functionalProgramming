trend over time from "how" to "what"

example: parallelism

1. multithreading
   - explicitly managing concurrency

2. fork/join parallelism
   - hides the threads under "tasks"
     - tasks can be implemented with threads
        but that's hidden from you
     - in fact, they coalesce tasks into a single thread when
        appropriate, etc.

3. streaming library
   - no explicit parallelism
   

holy grail: invent a general-purpose "what" language

Prolog and related languages are the best we have right now

the basic idea:

declare a set of *facts*

declare a set of *rules*
  - ways to learn new facts from old facts

a program is a *query* that asks what things are true
